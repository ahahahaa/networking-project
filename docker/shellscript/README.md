# Docker/shellscript

This directory contains the shellscript files that I used when I create my docker networks. Using shellscript can significantly save your time when you are constructing a docket network. 

The shellcripts are organized in several directories for different tests. Each shellscript contains a brief explanation in their header. There are also graphs of network design in each directory.
